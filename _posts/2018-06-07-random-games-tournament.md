We're bringing tournaments back, and to give an equal chance to everyone, it'll be a RANDOM GAMES tournament!

So what can you expect? Quick, intense local multiplayer, and crazy score-based single player... Spin the wheel and outskill (or outluck?) your opponent!

Oh, and of course... A prize for the winner ;)

Our schedule is as usual:   
18:00: Bar One for food and drinks   
19:30: Huttons

You don't need to bring anything to these socials, just show up and have fun playing games with us :)
