It's time for the last LAN of the year- LAN 70! Expect Fun, Large Multi-Player Games, Tournaments with Prizes, Big-Screen Console Gaming, Late Night Board Games, a Pub Quiz and Super Awesome Internet!

Please do not bring extension leads as our power network is very carefully worked out so that we don't short out the Ridge/cause a fire! We provide everyone with two power sockets (One for a monitor and one for a PC/console) so you shouldn't need one.

To bring a computer along to this event you need to purchase a LAN pass from our Union event page link at the top of this event page.

-- This is a Sheffield Students' Union event. You need to be a student or associate member of the Union and a member of SLUGSoc to attend.--
