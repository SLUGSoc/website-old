We'll be playing a classic this week: Bomberman Blast on the Wii; on the side, we'll have the fun fighting game Brawlhalla. If you've never heard of it, check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baixpNzE9es

Our schedule is back to normal:
18:00: Bar One for food and drinks
19:30: Huttons

You don't need to bring anything to these socials, just show up and have fun playing games with us :)
