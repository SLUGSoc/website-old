This week we'll be playing the classic Dreamcast game Power Stone 2, the multiplayer fighting game that has a wide variety of pick-up items to use, as well as Towerfall!

At the social, we'll also be holding a general meeting to decide on whether or not to increase the number of assistant tech positions as well as announce who has got them so make sure you come along! The meeting will probably be just in Bar One or Huttons but watch this space in case anything changes!

With the general meeting happening before hand in VR6, we'll be meeting there at 5pm, however the schedule is not changed for the rest of the social:

Bar One 6pm   
Huttons 7.30pm
