LAN favourites include <i>Quiplash 2</i>, <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</i>, <i>League of Legends</i> and <i>Left 4 Dead 2</i>, plus plenty more.

      If you've never been to a LAN before, look forward to a fun weekend of gaming! Bring your desktop/laptop/console and get ready to enjoy your favourite games with friends.

      LANs are normally hosted at the Ridge building on Ranmoor Student Village, a great Sheffield location just past Broomhill and central to most student accommodation. Attendees get a metre of desk to set up their gear, along with internet access and two plug sockets. Other LAN benefits include our 24/7 tuck shop for midnight munchies, a non-stop LAN playlist for tunes, quiet rooms for a nap, a pub quiz, and a Saturday night pizza order. Come and join us!

        If you've never been to a LAN before, look forward to a fun weekend of gaming! Bring your consoles or computers and get ready to enjoy your favourite games with friends old and new. We provide cheap snacks, lightning-fast internet and a sleeping area.<br />
        Games aren't all, though - you can expect a great playlist, a quiz, and the undying LAN tradition of Pizza Time. Perhaps we'll screen a film too?

  <p>As with any event at scale, we do have a Code of Conduct. We'll try and keep it short and sweet, but it's important that you <b>click to expand</b> each rule and <b>read them in full</b>.</p>
