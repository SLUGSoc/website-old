        We've run over 70 LAN events here at SLUGSoc. They're normally hosted at the Ridge building on Ranmoor student village, giving our players free rein to set up their gear and adventure together across an assortment of games. LAN favourites include <i>Quiplash 2</i>, <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</i>, <i>Overwatch</i> and <i>Guns of Icarus</i>.

        If you've never been to a LAN before, look forward to a fun weekend of gaming! Bring your console/desktop PC and get ready to enjoy your favourite games with friends. That aside, we provide cheap snacks, lightning-fast internet and a sleeping area.<br />
        Games aren't all, though - you can expect a great playlist, a quiz, and the undying LAN tradition of Pizza Time. Perhaps we'll screen a film too?

  <h2>LAN Rules</h2>
  <p>As with any event at scale, we do have a Code of Conduct. We'll try and keep it short and sweet, but it's important that you <b>click to expand</b> each rule and <b>read them in full</b>.</p>
