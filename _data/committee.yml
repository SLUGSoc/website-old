I'm mostly responsible for the site you're looking at right now, too, so [check out my site](https://simon.fish) or [the repo](https://github.com/slugsoc/website) to get in touch if you'd like tips! I'll be away for most of the year, but I won't let it stop me from helping out! Chances are you'll catch me at a LAN sometime. Aside from all the formalities, I mostly play Nintendo games, so if you'd like to make a friend (and proceed to lose them to a cruel game of Mario Party), you know who to call!"
